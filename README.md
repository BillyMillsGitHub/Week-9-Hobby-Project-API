#QA 22MayEnable2 Software Core - Practical Project Character Creator API


- This github repository will store all documentation for my Week 9 Hobby Project with QA Ltd.
- This project consists of creating a fully functional API from scratch. This must be inclusive of a well presented and readable front end plus a back end database with full CRUD functionality integration to the front end.



All applications used to develop this application within this project are:
- Version Control System ~ Git
- Source Code management ~ Github
- Kanban Board ~ Jira (Atlassian)
- Database ~ MySQL Server 5.7+ (local or cloud hosted)
- Back-end Development Platform ~ Java
- API Development Platform ~ Spring
- Front-End Web Technologies ~ HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- Build tool ~ Maven



The additional dependencies that were required for unit testing were:
- JUnit



Other additional applications and GUI / IDE that were used to create the project were:

- Eclipse IDE For Java Developers 2022-03
- VsCode
- Postman

You would need to download all of these applications to their latest update level in order to run this application effectively.



This UML shows how I would develop the application further if I were to progress further with the project.
